## My process💭

This is a simple project that I started by marking out initial classes and id's in the html file to be later used for styling. Next I began styling the css by styling the line, circles, and buttons. I then added functionality by way of JavaScript to switch between classes when the user clicks on a button.

### Built with👷🏾‍♀️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned👩🏾‍🏫

I learned the logic behind making a simple progress bar functional. I will be applying this to future projects where needed.

I also learned that when using the before or after selectors you MUST add content for the style to be visible.

### Continued development🔮

In the future I plan on continuing to practice positioning elements using flexbox, and using different selectors such as nth of type to select elements.

I also plan on continuing to practice using event listeners to make my pages more functional.

I also plan on continuing to learn the best ways to phrase git commits, so that future viewers can fully understand the changes that have occurred.

### I'm really proud of these code snippets✂️

```css
.progress-container::before {
  content: '';
  background-color: var(--line-border-empty);
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 0;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  height: 4px;
  width: 100%;
  z-index: -1;
}
```

```js
next.addEventListener('click', () => {
  currentActive++;

  if (currentActive > circles.length) {
    currentActive = circles.length;
  }
  update();
});

prev.addEventListener('click', () => {
  currentActive--;

  if (currentActive < 1) {
    currentActive = 1;
  }
  update();
});
```

### Useful resources📖

- [Resource](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) - This is an amazing article which helped me write better commit messages. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
